              A learnathon is a virtual two-day event held on April 22nd and
              23rd by Freetail Hackers for students of ALL backgrounds to learn
              about technology. We want to create an inclusive space for anyone
              interesed in techonology to learn and explore it. Attendees will
              get the chance to learn new skills, meet other people going
              through the learning journey, and create a project to showcase!

              The Learnathon is designed to help people from all backgrounds
              transform from tadpoles to code toads! On Saturday, April 3rd, we
              will have a day specifically designed for workshops. Most of these
              workshops will assume no prior knowledge and will be a space for
              anyone to learn. On Sunday, April 4th, we will have a hackathon
              that will give attendees a chance to use what they have learned to
              build a project. This can sound scary at first but we will give
              you the tools you need to go from no programming experience to
              building a project! Of course, the experience can be personalized
              as attendees have the option of attending just one or both of the
              two events.

              Anyone! We especially welcome and encourage students with little
              to no technical background to join us. Even if you're just vaguely
              interested in what the buzz around tech is, we are happy and
              excited to give you a glimpse into it. Additionally, all workshops
              will be recorded unless noted otherwise, so don't worry if you
              can't make it to a specific time; you can always watch afterwards.

            There are many resources we've prepared to help learn this weekend.
            The first is our Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide (UHSG). This was
            created by our teach and consists of tutorials, starter code, and
            links to more resources for the main technologies people use at
            hackathons. It goes over common hackathon logistics, whether or not
            you should use a certain technology, and where to get started with
            your project. The second resource is our Youtube Channel which
            contains all the workshops from our past year of events. If you
            don't see a topic you are interested in or just want to learn more
            about a certain area, feel free to browse around our channel and
            look for it. Finally, all of the organizers and mentors will be
            active on Discord to support you. We are all here to see you learn
            and succeed. Don't hesistate to reach out to us if you are feeling
            uncertain or have any questions!
